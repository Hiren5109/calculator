# 1. **HTML**: The HTML structure defines the layout of the calculator, including buttons for numbers, operators, and the display area to show the results.

# 2. **CSS**: CSS is used to style the HTML elements, giving the calculator a visually appealing design. This includes defining colors, fonts, sizes, and positioning of the calculator components.

# 3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript is the language responsible for the calculator's functionality. It handles user input, performs calculations, and updates the display accordingly. Event listeners are used to detect when the user clicks on a button, and functions are defined to carry out the appropriate actions based on the button clicked.

# Overall, the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows for the creation of a fully functional and visually appealing calculator web app that users can interact with to perform mathematical calculations.
